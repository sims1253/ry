## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Static resolution of `NAMESPACE` imports, including
  `importFrom(package, name)` and whole-package imports.
- Resolution of exports introduced by `library()` and `require()` without
  executing R or loading package code.
- Support for installed package libraries on Linux, macOS, Windows, and
  renv-managed projects.
- ANSI-colored human-readable diagnostics with
  `--color auto|always|never` and `NO_COLOR` support.
- `RY034` for comparisons with `NA` using `==` or `!=`.
- `RY041` for non-divisible vector recycling.
- `RY042` for arithmetic on factors.

### Fixed

- False-positive `RY010` diagnostics for imported package values such as
  bare `tags` imported from shiny.
- `requireNamespace()` no longer incorrectly introduces unqualified names.
- Package bindings no longer leak between unrelated packages checked together.
- Package-library and R-version precedence now respect the active project,
  including renv libraries.
- Several arithmetic, raw-vector, factor-comparison, assignment, and scope
  inference edge cases.

### Changed

- The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.88 and is verified in CI.
- Human and machine-readable diagnostic output are tested independently;
  JSON and CI formats never contain ANSI escapes.
