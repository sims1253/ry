# Changelog

All notable changes to ry are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Typed and required parameter metadata in typeshed signatures, including
  numeric mode unions and strict validation through `ry typeshed validate`.
- R-compatible exact, partial, and positional call-argument matching with
  `RY090` for unknown named arguments, `RY091` for missing required arguments,
  and `RY092` for provable argument type mismatches.

- Runtime custom typeshed loading through the `typeshed` key in `ry.toml` and
  repeatable `--typeshed` flags. Flat and nested stub layouts are supported,
  later directories replace earlier packages, and editor diagnostics use the
  same workspace configuration.
- The embedded typeshed is now a vendored snapshot of the standalone
  `r-typeshed` repository, with schema-version validation and source metadata.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

This release focuses on diagnostic precision, driven by audits of five
real-world CRAN packages (brms, posterior, bayesplot, loo, cmdstanr).
Total diagnostics across those clean corpora dropped from 837 (240
errors) to 30 (1 error — a genuine bug in brms), while all genuine
findings from the audits are still reported. The largest corpus checks
in under a second in release mode.

### Added

- S3 dispatch for operators: binary and unary `Ops` group methods
  (including operator-specific methods such as `+.classname`) defined in
  the checked sources or an attached package are now consulted before
  arithmetic and comparison diagnostics.
- Data-frame schema tracking: `data.frame()` derives column names from
  positional expressions (`data.frame(y, K)` has columns `y` and `K`),
  and column writes via `$`, `[[`, and partial indexed assignment update
  the tracked schema.
- Static dataset inventory: bindings introduced by a package's `data/`
  directory and by `load()` of a project `.rda`/`.RData` file are
  resolved by reading only the top-level tags of the R serialization
  stream (gzip, bzip2, and xz supported) — no R code is executed.
- NSE evaluation modes in typeshed stubs: parameters can be declared as
  data-masked, tidy-select, or quoted, so dplyr-style verbs resolve
  columns instead of flagging them as undefined globals.
- Typeshed stubs for testthat, plus expanded base, Bayesian-stack, and
  dplyr catalogues; stubs can also declare source-relative path
  arguments so `source("helper.R")`-style calls are followed.
- `globals` key in `ry.toml` for names created dynamically by the host
  application or an unresolvable `load()`; only the listed names become
  opaque, without suppressing other diagnostics.
- Lexical closure capture: names assigned anywhere in enclosing function
  bodies are visible inside nested closures, matching R's deferred
  lookup, without making direct read-before-assignment valid.
- Forwarded-default analysis: a formal forwarded into another function
  is credited with the callee's reachable defaults, removing false
  `NULL`-default condition warnings while keeping the genuine ones.

### Fixed

- `importFrom(pkg, name)` now preserves exact binding provenance when a
  stub for the dependency exists, falling back to opaque otherwise.
- Numeric truthiness idioms (e.g. `if (length(x))`) and list/atomic
  equality comparisons no longer produce false diagnostics.
- Various false positives around class-attribute assignment, nested
  record-path writes, S3 predicate narrowing, and dplyr join calls.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Static resolution of `NAMESPACE` imports, including
  `importFrom(package, name)` and whole-package imports.
- Resolution of exports introduced by `library()` and `require()` without
  executing R or loading package code.
- Support for installed package libraries on Linux, macOS, Windows, and
  renv-managed projects.
- ANSI-colored human-readable diagnostics with
  `--color auto|always|never` and `NO_COLOR` support.
- `RY034` for comparisons with `NA` using `==` or `!=`.
- `RY041` for non-divisible vector recycling.
- `RY042` for arithmetic on factors.

### Fixed

- False-positive `RY010` diagnostics for imported package values such as
  bare `tags` imported from shiny.
- `requireNamespace()` no longer incorrectly introduces unqualified names.
- Package bindings no longer leak between unrelated packages checked together.
- Package-library and R-version precedence now respect the active project,
  including renv libraries.
- Several arithmetic, raw-vector, factor-comparison, assignment, and scope
  inference edge cases.

### Changed

- The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.88 and is verified in CI.
- Human and machine-readable diagnostic output are tested independently;
  JSON and CI formats never contain ANSI escapes.
